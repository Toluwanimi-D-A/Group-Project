# Group Project
A data analysis and visualization project focused on Spotify's top songs from 2000 to 2019. It explores music trends, artist popularity, genre distributions, and other track characteristics using Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint.

# Project Overview
This project examines Spotify's most popular tracks between 2000 and 2019 using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. By analyzing attributes like danceability, energy, explicit content, and genre trends, we provide insights into listener preferences and the evolution of music streaming culture.

# Project Components
-Data Cleaning: Conducted in Microsoft Excel using Power Query. Checked data types, corrected inconsistencies, removed duplicates, and handled missing values.

-Data Analysis: Focused on answering key questions such as:

i. Who are the most popular artists?

ii. What is the trend in explicit content over the years?

iii. How does tempo relate to danceability?

iv. Which genres and years were most dominant?

-Data Visualization: Built in Power BI to reveal insights through bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.

-Presentation: Summarized findings and recommendations in a PowerPoint deck.

# Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning and preparation.

Power BI: For interactive data visualization and dashboards.

PowerPoint: For documenting findings and presenting insights.

# Key Insights
-Pop and Hip-Hop dominate the top genres.

-Danceability and tempo show a weak direct correlation.

-Explicit content grew steadily but still, 85% of tracks are non-explicit.

-Top artists capture the majority of streams.

-Live recordings have an appeal across multiple genres.

# Recommendations
-Spotify could leverage collaboration with top artists for exclusive content.

-There is a potential to promote upcoming artists.

-Attention should be paid to the balance between explicit and non-explicit content.

-Focus should be on dance-friendly elements beyond just tempo.

# How to Use
-Open the .pbix file with Power BI to interact with the visualizations.
